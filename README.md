vagrantScrapybox
================

It's convenient to use VM's for one-off data acquisition tasks. A vanilla Ubuntu scrapy box can be provisioned:

    git clone https://github.com/alexwoolford/vagrantScrapybox
    cd vagrantScrapybox
    vagrant up

This assumes that vagrant (with the hashicorp/precise64 box) and Ansible are setup on the host machine.
